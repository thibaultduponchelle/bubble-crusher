##Generalities 


Hope you will enjoy it !


##Install

As it's python + pygtk ... You need python (2.6 or 2.7 is ok) and pytgtk.

And type :

`sudo setup.py install`


The files will be installed somewhere on you machine. On mine it's here :

`/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/bubblecrusher`

Currently the config file is in this place too.

A bash script is installed in a place like /usr/bin


#Play

Simply run `bubblecrusher` from a terminal and have fun.


#About

As the company who developped this game refused to help me to do this port and to even mention its name, I have done everything including the graphix, logo, and so on.
